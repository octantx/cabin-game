# cabin-game

The Cabin is a terminal based game made in the Python language. Created for a computer science project it turned into a mass of code at over 9000+ lines (the biggest I've ever achieved). The game itself is a horror text adventure where you can perform actions, look at objects, and piece together the mystery of your arrival.
